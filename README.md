# **Model Development (UCI Imports-85 & Laptop Pricing)**

This repository provides a complete Model Development workflow for two datasets ‚Äî the Automobile (Imports-85) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and a Laptop Pricing dataset.

The project focuses on understanding feature patterns, relationships, and statistical insights through EDA, followed by the development of regression models to predict target variables such as price.

# üìå Dataset Overview

1Ô∏è‚É£ Automobile Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository ‚Äì Automobile Dataset

Rows: 205

Attributes: 26 (mix of categorical, continuous, and integer values)

Common Target Variable: price

2Ô∏è‚É£ Laptop Pricing Dataset

A dataset containing specifications and prices of various laptop models. Used for exploring relationships between configuration features and price prediction.


# üßÆ Model Development Workflow

Following the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), this phase focuses on developing and evaluating regression models for predicting target variables such as price.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Single Linear Regression

Develop a Simple Linear Regression model using one predictor variable (e.g., horsepower ‚Üí price).

Fit the model and visualize the regression line.

Assess the relationship strength and interpret coefficients.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Multiple Linear Regression

Build a Multiple Linear Regression model using multiple independent variables (e.g., engine-size, curb-weight, horsepower, highway-mpg).

Evaluate the significance of each feature and interpret regression coefficients.

Analyze model fit and performance metrics.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation Using Visualization

Use graphical methods to assess model accuracy and residual behavior:

Regression Plot: Compare predicted vs. actual values.

Residual Plot: Check for randomness and constant variance.

Distribution Plot: Evaluate how well predictions match the actual data distribution.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Polynomial Regression with Pipelines

Implement Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships.

Use PolynomialFeatures and integrate with Pipeline to automate feature transformation and model fitting.

Compare linear and polynomial model performances.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Polynomial Features

Generate higher-degree and interaction terms to model non-linear behavior.

Examine improvements in model fit while monitoring for overfitting.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Pipeline

Construct an ML pipeline to streamline preprocessing, feature transformation, and model training.

Automate scaling, polynomial generation, and regression fitting within a single workflow.

Ensure consistency and reproducibility in model building.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Measures for In-Sample Evaluation

Evaluate model performance for:

Model 1: Simple Linear Regression

Model 2: Multiple Linear Regression

Model 3: Polynomial Fit

Use key metrics for comparison:

R¬≤ Score ‚Äì goodness of fit

Mean Squared Error (MSE) ‚Äì average squared difference between actual and predicted values

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) ‚Äì average absolute difference

Prediction and Decision Making:
Use model insights to guide feature importance analysis, price prediction, and data-driven decision-making.
